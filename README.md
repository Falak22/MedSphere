# MedSphere (Medical Insurance Cost Prediction)
This project is built using the results of a Machine Learning algorithm (multiple linear regression model). Medical costs are difficult to predict since most money comes from the rare conditions of the patients. The objective of this project is to accurately predict insurance costs based on peopleâ€™s data, including age, Body Mass Index, smoking or not, etc. It can be used by Medicare administrators to forecast expenditure for future months and years and plan the budget accordingly.




This repo contains a lot of basics such as Data preprocessing, Data Visualization, Prediction using various models and tuning their Hyper parameters. Also, the best model was chosen and was deployed using Flask locally.
Topics Covered :
Exploring the dataset
Converting Categorical values to Numerical
Plotting Heatmap to see dependency of Dependent valeu on Independent features
Data Visualization (Plots of feature vs feature)
Plotting Skew and Kurtosis
Data Preparation
Prediction using Linear Regression
Prediction using SVR
Prediction using Ridge Regressor
Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
Performing Hyper tuning for above mentioned models
Plotting Graph for all Models to compare performance
Preparing model for deployment
Deployed model using Flask
