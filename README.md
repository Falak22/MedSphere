# MedSphere (Medical Insurance Cost Prediction)
This project is built using the results of a Machine Learning algorithm (multiple linear regression model). Medical costs are difficult to predict since most money comes from the rare conditions of the patients. The objective of this project is to accurately predict insurance costs based on peopleâ€™s data, including age, Body Mass Index, smoking or not, etc. It can be used by Medicare administrators to forecast expenditure for future months and years and plan the budget accordingly.




This repo contains a lot of basics such as Data preprocessing, Data Visualization, Prediction using various models and tuning their Hyper parameters. Also, the best model was chosen and was deployed using Flask locally.
Topics Covered :
Exploring the dataset
